# Object's position and orientation detection

This repo is part of the UniTN's project for the course of "Fondamenti di Robotica" held by prof. Luigi Palopoli.
The scripts in this repo have the goal of identifying the centre and orientation of a mega block in gazebo in order for the UR5's end effector to be able to reach the object and grab it.
